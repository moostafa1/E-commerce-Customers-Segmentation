# Project: Power BI Dashboard & Customer Segmentation

## Overview  
This project consists of two key tasks:  
1. **Building a Power BI Dashboard** to provide stakeholders with insightful visualizations for data-driven decision-making.  
2. **Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning** to classify customers based on their transactional behavior.

## Task 1: Build a Dashboard for Stakeholders using Power BI  

### Objective  
Design and develop a structured and informative dashboard that presents key insights from the dataset. This dashboard will be tailored for stakeholders, including business managers and marketing teams, to help them make informed decisions.  

### Key Visualizations  
- **Customer Demographics**: Breakdown of customers by gender and city.  
- **Coupon Usage**: Insights into coupon transaction status (e.g., claimed vs. burnt coupons) over time.  
- **Top-performing Cities/Branches**: Identification of cities or branches with the highest number of successful coupon burns.  
- **Customer Retention and Loyalty**: Analysis of customer coupon usage frequency and trends over time.

## Task 2: Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning  

### Objective  
Develop and train an unsupervised machine learning model to segment customers based on their transactional behavior and other relevant features. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups and leverage these segments to improve coupon-based marketing strategies.  

### Key Instructions  

1. **Feature Selection**  
   - Utilize customer demographic features (e.g., gender, city).  
   - Incorporate transactional features (e.g., coupon usage frequency, transaction status).  

2. **Model Development**  
   - Train and evaluate an unsupervised machine learning model (e.g., K-Means).  
   - Experiment with different cluster numbers and optimize the model for meaningful customer groups.  

3. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Use appropriate metrics for unsupervised learning, such as:  
     - **Inertia** (for K-Means).

## Technologies Used  
- **Power BI** – For building the interactive dashboard.  
- **Python (scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)** – For customer segmentation analysis.  

## Conclusion  
This project provides stakeholders with a powerful data visualization tool while leveraging machine learning to uncover valuable customer insights. The insights gained can drive strategic marketing decisions and improve customer engagement.
